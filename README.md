===============
(Summer 2014) Materials from a presentation given 6/30/2014 for the New York Python meetup group.

Demonstrates how I loaded performance timing measurements into pandas, then performed some simple visualizations (in matplotlib and Bokeh) and a simple analysis (checking for a lagged autocorrelation in timing intervals in rhythmic performance).

The main rhythm analysis demo: [rhythm-analysis-demo.ipynb on nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coej/pandas-examples/blob/master/rhythm-analysis-demo.ipynb)

Basic pandas functionality: [pandas-general-demo.ipynb on nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/coej/pandas-examples/blob/master/pandas-general-demo.ipynb)

This walks through some ways to clean data visually with pandas, but the same process is done much more efficiently in the "clean_data.py" script here: https://github.com/coej/sync-data
