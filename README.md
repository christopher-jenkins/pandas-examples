===============
(Summer 2014) Materials from a presentation given 6/30/2014 for the New York Python meetup group.

Demonstrates how I loaded performance timing measurements into pandas, then performed some simple visualizations (in matplotlib and Bokeh) and a simple analysis (checking for a lagged autocorrelation in timing intervals in rhythmic performance).

The main analysis demo is here: http://coej.github.io/documents/rhythm-analysis-demo.html
